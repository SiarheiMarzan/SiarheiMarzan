- 👋 Hi, I’m @SiarheiMarzan
- 👀 I am interested in participating in projects using the creation of automated test cases in the Java language. 
- 🌱 I have completed a course on automated testing in Java(Selenium, Selenide, Cucumber), but I have no experience in this project, I really
      want to get it and consolidate my skills. Now I am additionally studying the Java programming language to improve my skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
