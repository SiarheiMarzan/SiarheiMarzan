As a Software Test Automation Engineer in Java, I have developed expertise in a range of technical areas. I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner with experience in programming Java and building Test Automation Frameworks using Maven, Gradle, Selenium, Selenide, TestNG, and JUnit5. I also have experience in Rest API testing with Postman and Rest Assured, and I am familiar with project management and defect tracking tools such as Jira.
In addition to my technical skills, I have practical experience in manual software testing, including functional testing, test execution on web, iOS, and Android applications, bug reporting, and retesting. Some of the technologies and tools I have used include Git, Report Portal, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, Docker, Lombok, Cucumber, and Gerkin.
I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of software testing and automation, and I am passionate about finding creative solutions to complex problems. I am also a strong collaborator and enjoy working in a team environment.
